# Acme Sports

Acme Sports is a full-stack web application I built using **Next.js**, **Prisma**, **Axios**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **PostgreSQL**. This app displays and manages sports-related data‚Äîcurrently focused on NFL teams‚Äîwith the potential to scale into other leagues.

To simulate a real-world scenario where users access web services via authenticated requests‚Äîtypically using an API key. I have implemented:

- ‚úÖ User authentication using API keys
- ‚úÖ Dynamic and filterable data (like NFL teams)
- ‚úÖ Server-rendered pages for SEO
- ‚úÖ Full-stack development using the latest Next.js App Router

## üì¶ Installation

1. Download the ZIP.
2. Unzip and navigate to the `acme-sports` directory.
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

**It will work without running the seed because i have used remote db and already seeded the data and .env local file contains API KEY and pg db connection url**

To run the application in dev mode.
```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to app.
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

## üîê Authentication via API KEY

I've implemented **two methods** for handling API key authentication:

---

### 1. Automatic API Key Injection (Default Branch)
- The API key is securely stored in the `.env` file.
- A custom `axios` instance automatically includes the API key in the request headers.
- Any request made **from the client application** (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) will include the API key by default.
- Also accessing backend apis `http://localhost:3000/api/*` will automatically include api key (due to middleware configuration, as middleware sends a axios request to validate api key, so sending a axios means api key is already in headers)

### 2. Change the git branch to `feat/explicit-api-key`
  - This method is ideal for **external API testing** (e.g., using Postman or cURL).
- You need to **manually set** the API key in the headers for a request:

  ```http
  X-API-KEY: 74684188-7553-441d-92ee-b9da9ead2b75
  ```
- If the API key is missing or invalid, the server returns an appropriate error message with status codes.


## üé® UI/UX + SEO

The client had no specific design or UX expectations, so I took the initiative to build a clean, modern layout with logical navigation, responsiveness, and search/filtering.

- `/nfl/teams` lists all NFL teams with filtering, grouping, and search (Client side routing).
- Group by **conference** or **division**.
- Sort by **name**, **conference**, or **division**.
- All functionality works both client-side and server-side.
- SSR ensures fast load and is SEO-ready.

## üßê API Design

Endpoint:
`GET /api/team_list/{league}?sort_by=name|conference|division`

Responses:

‚úÖ Valid request:

```json
{ "data": [ ...teams ], "description": "Successful operation" }
```

‚ùå Invalid league:

```json
{ "error": "Please provide a valid league name to fetch team list.", "description": "invalid request" }
```

---

## üîê Auth via Middleware

All API routes are protected using middleware that verifies an `x-api-key` in the request header.

- If no api key is provided in headers:

```json
{ "error": "API key is required.", "description": "unauthenticated", "status": 401 }
```

- If the key is invalid:

```json
{ "error": "Invalid API key", "description": "unauthorized", "status": 403 }
```

The middleware avoids Prisma (DB access) directly by internally calling `/api/auth/validate-api-key`, keeping it edge-compatible.
